# Turnable Kotlin/Jetpack Compose edition
![Artwork](artwork/Turnable_kt.png)
## DISCLAIMER:
Warning! App contains is made out of trash code and is still in very bad development!
THIS IS MY FIRST TRY AT LEARNING KOTLIN AND IT'S TECHNOLOGIES! PLEASE, UNDERSTAND THAT THE TRASH CODE IS INEVITABLE!
## Ooo! What is this?
Turnable is a player that allows users to play files from network with streaming over HTTP. It uses ExoPlayer2 as it's base and has a pretty slick design which is gonna be inspired by Material Design 3 in this release!
## Why does this thing exist...
This is a kind of spinoff of the original app in Kotlin and Compose that would try to follow Android's recommended practices.
