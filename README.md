Make it turn!
## DISCLAIMER:
Warning! App contains a lot of trash code and is still in development!
Please, understand that this is my first ever usable app made, thanks!
## Ooo! What is this?
Turnable is a player that allows users to play files from network with streaming over HTTP. It uses ExoPlayer2 as it's base and has a pretty slick design.
## Why does this thing exist...
This was created as a final project for a Samsung Innovation Campus IT School course. Pretty fun thing to do, let me say!
